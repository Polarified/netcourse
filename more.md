# More for You

When it comes to learning things, the only true way to do it, is to try and make something you think is cool.
Otherwise, you won't do it. Learning things without using them sucks!

#### Ideas
Here are a list of ideas for you to try and do and explore:
* Cyber
    1. Make a networking toolkit (network & port scanner, traceroute, nslookup, etc.) using scapy!
    2. Make a key-sniffer or screenshotting script, that sends what it finds on computers it runs on to your computer!
    3. Try to do a MITM on a device on your home network! (What is a MITM?)
* Developmental
    1. Make your own version of Wireshark using scapy!
    2. Make a game (like four in a row, for example) and then make it multiplayer.
        * Do you want to have one of the two players be a server and the other a client? Or do you want to have one main server, and players join as clients and match up?
    3. Write a server and client using sockets that does something useful for you! Make up your own protocol to allow them to communicate.
    4. Make a chatroom for you and your friends!
    5. Expand the chatroom, and make it a game like skribbl.io... pretty cool idea if I do say so myself.
    
#### Resources

Here is a summary of resources I recommend for continuing to learn networking:
1. The cyber.il networks pdf includes a good overview of networking. However, it isn't in the right order (in my opinion).
I recommend going over the chapters in the following order, refreshing what you already know and learning more:
Chapter 1 -> 3 -> 10 -> 8 -> 7 -> 9 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4-> the rest. You may have problems where the book expects you to know something that you don't - do your best to deal with it!
2. Youtube is your best friend: try channels like NeuralNine, Tech with Tim, freeCodeCamp, and more.
3. Try to think about what you want to do, then learn what you need. Not the other way around.

Good luck!
